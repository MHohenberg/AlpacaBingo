* Alpaca Bingo

A small, stupid Bingo card, intended for use in online streams, particularly
those involving large herds of /vicugna pacos/.

** Installation

You need a webserver able to run PHP scripts. 

Bingo card words are in the keywords.org file, one word per line. You may want to roll your own, if you do, please do *not* commit it.

** Plans for the future

- A game master mode intended to allow for prizes to be won
- individually accessible bingo cards 
- a way to distinguish between high-frequency, middle-frequency and low-frequency keywords, to make this fair.
