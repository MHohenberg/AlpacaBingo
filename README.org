* Alpaca Bingo

A small, stupid bingo card game, intended for use in online streams, particularly
those involving large herds of /vicugna pacos/.

** Installation

You need a webserver able to run PHP scripts. 

Bingo card terms are saved in the keywords.org file, one word per line. You may want to roll your own, if you do, please do *not* commit it.

** Features
- Bingo cards are created based on statistics on former games, to make large lists more fair
- Spectator mode: Each card has an uuid, and can be watched by other players to verify bingo has tken place.
- Statistics: See which tiers the terms are in (higher tiers get used in card creation more often) and which never are used. Also see the number of active sessions.
